<h1> Beginner Python Project - Python Classes for Automobile and Car</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of a Python implementation of two classes, 'Automobile' and 'Car', designed as part of an object-oriented programming exercise. The 'Automobile' class models a general vehicle with attributes such as make, model, mileage, and price, providing methods to set and get these attributes. The 'Car' class, which inherits from 'Automobile', extends its functionality by adding an attribute for the number of doors and includes corresponding methods to set and get this attribute. This project demonstrates key object-oriented programming principles including encapsulation, inheritance, and method implementation.
